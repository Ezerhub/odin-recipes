# odin-recipes
First project from the Odin course , based on HTML .
After i have completed the project i will write a couple of thoughts on what i learned and what skills i have used .
UPDATE : I have completed the project !! i had to build a basic website with an index which linked to 3 recipes . Every Recipe Page has an image, a Description , an Unordered list of Ingredients and an Ordered list of Steps of my Recipe.
Everything works just fine and i commit, iteration to iteration, my page and pushed it on my GitHub.
Was a fun project but pretty simple TBH. I Hope i get to do more complicated things in the future . Now is time to work with CSS !
