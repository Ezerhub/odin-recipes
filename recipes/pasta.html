        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Bolognese pasta sauce is a crowd-pleaser, takes next to no effort, and can be made with fresh or dried herbs that you probably already have in your pantry!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>2 (29 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons dried basil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons onion powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. </li>
            <li>Stir tomato sauce, basil, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper into beef. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook sauce at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and rich, about 1 hour. </li>
            <li> Fresh herbs really add an extra layer of flavor. If I have any of the ingredients fresh, I substitute: 1 cup basil, chopped; 1 cup oregano, chopped, 2 onions, finely chopped; or 3 cloves garlic, minced.

                This makes enough sauce for 2 boxes of pasta; it freezes well. </li>
        </ol>
